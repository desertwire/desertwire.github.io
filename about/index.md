<big> <b> Desert Digital &#127797; </b> </big>
<br> This site was created as a tool to learn web development.
The name <i>Desert Digital</i> was appropriate since I work in tech and am stranded in the Arizonan Desert. 
My goals in tech are to continually improve my skills by working on software and engineering related projects.

<big> <b> The Importance of Knowing a Second Language </b> </big>
<br> Learning a second language has helped me better understand the cultures of other individuals.  
Aside from tech, having a full professional proficiency in Chinese is a priority of mine. 
I use <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/" style="text-decoration: none"> <u> Anki </u> </a> everyday to memorize Characters and Pinyin.
Anki is really useful for building a strong vocabulary in a second language. 
It's quicker than using flashcards and you can sync the cards to multiple devices.
<a href="https://www.pleco.com/" style="text-decoration: none"> <u>Pleco</u> </a>
is another useful tool, it's an offline Chinese dictionary used on mobile.
The coolest part about this app is scanning the characters with your camera.
The term "Just Pleco It" has become a common phrase of mine.

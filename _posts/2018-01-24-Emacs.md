Among my peers, I often get asked the question what text editor I use.
The simplest answer I give is "All of them, but I like Emacs."


## Baby's First Steps: Nano

</p>


Like most people, I started out using Nano.
Back in 2015, I was fairly new to GNU/Linux and had no experience with command line navigation.
To practice writing C code, I needed a terminal based text editor.
I chose Nano because I was only doing basic tasks and Emacs and Vim had steeper learning curves.
To me, it seemed more efficient to write and compile code directly from a terminal.
GUI text editors were visually appealing, but the mouse movement was more time consuming for the tasks I was trying to accomplish.
As I wrote more and more C code, I became quite dissatisfied with Nano.
Although I was saving time using the terminal, it was hard to navigate across files using only the arrow keys.
I made the decision to learn another text editor,
because although it would have a steeper learning curve,
writing programs would be more efficient.


## The Transition to Emacs

</p>

After Nano, I made the switch to Emacs.
Unlike Vim, I could still use the arrow keys while learning new commands.
This allowed me to learn the basics without getting complete stuck within the buffer.
To learn Emacs, I taped a cheat sheet to my wall.
I used this cheat sheet and wrote song lyrics using only Emacs commands.
This was good practice, but the only true way to learn Emacs was to live within the Linux shell.
No longer would I use IDE's to compile projects.
Instead of having an IDE automatically correct code,
all my code was debugged through GCC.
This helped me develop a muscle memory for the commands and
allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of C.
It was at this time where I also learned how to use Arch Linux.
I learned the basics of using a Linux Distro with a bleeding edge user repository.
This Distro offered more customization for the user than a more stable Debian system.
This was when I discovered the true power behind Emacs.

## Melpa: The Powerhouse behind Emacs

Like Arch, Emacs also offers a User Repository based package manager.
The Package Manager is called Melpa, and offers over 3500 packages.
I discovered Melpa when I was attempting to write Rust code on Emacs.
Like C, Rust is also an Embedded Systems Language but is fairly new.
It's so new that Emacs doesn't offer syntax highlighting.
Through browsing GitHub, I was able to find a package for Rust syntax highlighting.
To my surprise it was offered through Melpa and could be downloaded without having to adjust the Emacs dot file.
I spent the next few weeks trying to automate tasks in Emacs.
If there was a package that could make my routine easier, I would install it.
Emacs almost feels like a separate operating system by itself.
Through Emacs you can compile, write, and push code to GitHub.
That's not all through, on Emacs you can download packages to play games, watch movies, and even stream Spotify.
The package manager behind Emacs is highly customizable and it is for this reason I use Emacs.


## Entering the Land of Vim

I decided learning Vim would be beneficial if I was to continue using Linux.
Unlike Emacs, Vim is installed by default on most Linux distributions.
If there was ever a time where I couldn't install Emacs, Vim would be my only option.
It was much easier learning Vim, after having learned Emacs.
Currently, I use Vim to write LaTeX documents.
Vim offers more customization for its macro shortcuts which makes writing documents more efficient.
I personally prefer Emacs's keyboard shortcuts over Vim's two navigation modes, but they both work.
In the end you should use what's most comfortable and for me that's Emacs.

## Returning to Emacs and Working With GUI Editors

Like I said at the beginning, I like Emacs but will use any text editor.
Eventually I came to the realization that most people prefer to work with GUI text editors. Visual Studio, Eclipse, and Atom are all great editors for working in a team setting.  They all include built in debuggers which makes debugging larger scaled projects much easier. As an Emacs user I wasn't left entirely dissatisfied.
Both Eclipse and Atom, have downloadable packages that allow the user to run Emacs commands. I was at least able to stay loyal to my favorite editor. While I would prefer to have my team work in Emacs, I also must realize that it's not necessary for team collaboration.

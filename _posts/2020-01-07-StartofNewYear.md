Well it's definitley been awhile but what changes lay in store for 2020?

<p> 
Judging how the last post was from 2018, I think it was safe to say the website briefly died.
While the website was mostly focused on Computer Systems related content,
I plan focus more on language learning and personal development.
The site now has it's 

<a href="http://www.neckbeardjones.com/" style="text-decoration: none"> <u> own domain</u></a> 

instead of just being hosted on 


<a href="https://desertwire.github.io" style="text-decoration: none"> <u> GitHub pages</u></a>.


Hopefully 2020 leads towards more changes on this site.

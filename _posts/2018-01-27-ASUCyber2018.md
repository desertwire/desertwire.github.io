[ASU](https://www.asu.edu/) hacking events require a unique set of skills
but what does it take to actually compete?

## Intro

This weekend I had the opportunity to compete in ASU's
[Cyber Security Challenge](https://publicservice.asu.edu/content/cybersecurity-student-challenge])
sponsored by
[Terra Verde](https://www.terraverdeservices.com/).
This event was to raise awareness for Cybersecurity in America, a field currently in need of
[200,000 jobs](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2017/03/16/the-fast-growing-job-with-a-huge-skills-gap-cyber-security/#5dc780f85163).
The goal of this challenge was to crack all problems in the given amount of time.
Every time a problem was solved, the team earns a flag, and the team with the most flags win.
Topics for these challenges included reversing binaries, programming, packet sniffing, and Linux network fundamentals.
So what do you need to do to compete?

## Gear Needed

Technically you can hack with any OS and tool that helps solve the problem.
In reality the most successful groups were running Linux distributions with open source tools.
The reason why is that the UNIX Command Line is essential for solving these problems, which runs natively on Linux distributions. My gear consisted of a ThinkPad x220 running [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) and another ThinkPad x200 running [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/). The extra laptop was in case an additional group member forgot theirs. Out of my two other teammates, one was using a Mac and the other was using Debian with a Windows Vista Virtual Machine (VM). The Mac user was able to complete the challenges using a macOS terminal. My other partner had Windows related issues with downloading files on [Putty](https://www.putty.org/). For this reason he chose to stick with Debian.

## Itâ€™s All About Being Ethical
The purpose of being an ethical hacker is to help identify and prevent potential vulnerabilities from unethical hackers. To avoid any potential issues at ASU, all hacking was to be done on a remote server.
While connected to the remote server, you could not access the Web.
Students were allowed to access ASU's main Wifi but had to disconnect from the remote server first.
Users with more than one computer had the advantage of both accessing the web and solving the problems.

## Not Relying on Google to Solve Your Problems.
While we did have access to the web it didn't prove to be entirely useful either.
The challenges were designed to be unique, so you couldn't just Google the problem.
Most time spent on the problem was from reading the `man` (manual) pages.
The `man` pages are a collection of descriptions on how to use a Unix command.
An extensive amount of information is included within these pages, so they are important to read.
Reading the `man` pages is [the most reliable way of getting help in UNIX](http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~guide/help/man.html).
This task proved to be very effective and helped improve our understanding of the UNIX commands.

## It Is Beginner Friendly
There is no risk of going to these events if you are entirely new to Cyber Security.
One of my partners was entirely new to these challenges.
She was still able to solve the problems through effective teamwork and reading the `man` pages.
You don't need to be in a Cyber Security related degree to contribute, it just helps.
More people should go to these events because you will learn useful skills and might discover a new passion.

## Wireshark Is a Powerful Tool
The packet sniffing problems were a major part of this event.
This section included analyzing data stored in open capture files (.pcap).
The tool we chose to use was Wireshark since it is the defacto standard packet analyzer.
In this exercise, we were given fictional set of data which contained an Email from a runaway girl.  
From these files we were able to identify the sender, the receiver, and the subject of the email.
But that's not all, the most fascinating part of this activity was being able to decrypt her password.
This exercise taught me the true power of Wireshark and that it's an important tool for Cyber Security.

## How to prepare for ASU Hacking Events
I had a lot of fun at this event and look forward to attending next years event.
The resources I used to prepare were very beneficial for cracking these problems.
Below are a list of recommended resources for getting started with Ethical Hacking.
* Security Concepts - [Bandit Wargames](http://overthewire.org/wargames/)  
* Binary Hacking - [LiveOverflow](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClcE-kVhqyiHCcjYwcpfj9w)
* Programming - [Python Challenge](http://www.pythonchallenge.com/)
* Packet Sniffing - [Wireshark Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTSc2mPF4II)
* Linux - The best way to learn Linux is to use it as your main OS. [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/) and [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/) are good beginner distros to try out.

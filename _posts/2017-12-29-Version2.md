<p> 

Now begins the second installment of Desert Digital.
The previous website consisted of only HTML and CSS written from scratch.
While the
<a href="https://desertdigital1.github.io/" style="text-decoration: none"> <u> old design</u></a> was very appealing, it needed a more modern approach.
A lot of feedback given towards the previous version was that it looked too much like a PDF document.
More issues consisted of the viewing differences between mobile and desktop.
The second version of this site eliminates these issues entirely. 
It makes customization easier and now takes advantage of Sass and Data Files.
